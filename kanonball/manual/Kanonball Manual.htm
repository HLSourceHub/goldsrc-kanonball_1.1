      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">When you enter a Kanonball server, you will automatically be placed
      in spectator mode, and you will be presented with the Spawning Grid.</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">The
      Spawning Grid has been designed to let payers know at a glance how many
      players are on each team, what body type they are, and what position they
      are playing.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">The
      top most point of the Grid shows the Ruck, the bottom most the Goal

      and rear Flanks.</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Upon

      </span>When a position is taken, it will be replaced by an icon on the grid, and
      you will not be able to select it.</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">When
      you switch positions using 1-6, your viewpoint will change, showing you
      your new location in relation to the ball launcher.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

      </span><a name="Playing tips">Playing tips</a></b></p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">General:</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Despite
      the fact that Kanonball is a 'mod' for Half-Life, the player controls are
      different (in some ways) to all other FPS styled games. To make the most
      out of playing Kanonball, players are well advised to spend a few minutes
      getting familiar with the control set up. Several keys have different
      functions, depending on the situation and relative control input. For
      example - the throw key is the same as the catch key and the pass key also
      doubles as the charge key. Because there are certain actions you can
      perform when in possession of the ball and visa versa, there are various
      functions that some keys can perform.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Before
      expecting to become Kanonball champions, players should at least teach
      themselves the basics of throwing, catching and moving. Kanonball allows
      players to perform many actions and knowing the full compliment of moves
      empowers players to employ a diverse range of possible moves, attacks,
      defenses and playing strategies. It is possible to develop most individual
      actions by practicing within a single player game.</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">It
      is highly recommended that players practice moving around and
      experimenting with throwing and catching functions. Practicing by throwing
      a ball against a wall and catching when it rebounds is a great way to
      learn throwing and catching techniques. Practice catching the ball in mid
      air, both in normal jumps and power-jumps to acquire an advanced feel for
      the controls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Movement:</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">The
      control interface of Kanonball is unique, due to the complexity of some of
      the moves the athletic clones can perform. For the most part, Kanonball
      employs a standard first-person-shooter style movement set up, although
      several actions will cause the view camera to cut to a cinematic style 3rd
      person perspective.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">The
      transitions to 3rd person are brief, and will generally occur when the
      player performs an action that causes them to loose a certain amount of
      movement control. Player control, however, has not been fully taken away
      from the player. It is possible to catch during mid-backflips, dive-rolls,
      slide kicks and dodge flips. These functions operate in 3rd person
      transitions in much the same way they (will) operate in exclusive 3rd
      person playing perspectives.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Teamwork:</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Teamwork
      is imperative for success in Kanonball - like any sport; games are won by
      controlling the ball. The fastest way to foster teamwork within the team
      is to use the pass key (often) to move the ball between teammates. Pass
      throws will automatically pass the ball towards the nearest team-mate
      (closest to center of view), and they can be performed any time that the
      player is in possession of the ball. Passing is the fastest way to receive
      a ball and get it to your teammates.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Catching:</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Remember
      the first time someone threw a ball at you and asked you to catch it? It
      hit you on the chest and dropped to the ground... right? The same thing
      will happen to you in Kanonball, unless you actually attempt to catch the
      ball when it gets close enough for you to grab. And unlike your early
      years in Primary school, Kanonball uses a solid steel ball - so we suggest
      you learn to use the catch function ASAP, because otherwise it will knock
      you down.</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">The
      catch key is the same as the throwing key (mouse1 by default). When you
      don't have the ball, you can catch. When you acquire the ball, the same
      key will throw it. Upon catching the ball, however, the throw / catch key
      must be released before the ball can be thrown again. Passing, on the
      other hand can be done as soon as you catch the ball. You will note a successful
      catch / grab with a quick flash across the screen, which will be tinted
      with the same color of the team you are playing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Throwing:</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Throwing
      (as opposed to passing) can produce more deliberately aimed throws, and is
      the best way to perform long throws or shoot for goal. It is possible for
      the player to throw the ball at variable distances and speeds. This is
      done by holding down the 'throw' key, and releasing it when the player is
      ready to throw it. The longer the player holds down the throw key, the
      further and faster the ball will travel (approx 1 second for full
      charge). Your target is your goal which is the <u>same color as your team.</u></p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto" align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="ingame-throw.jpg" width="313" height="453"></p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Dive
      attack:</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto" align="left">The
      dive-attack has swiftly proven to become the most popular of all Kanonball
      special attacks. Upon performing this move, the player will launch
      themselves forward in a leaping dive roll. This move enables players to
      move forward quickly and knock opponents down, and it is also possible to
      catch the ball during mid-roll. Indeed, this is a great way to steal the
      ball from under your opponents nose. To perform the forward dive, run
      forwards and press 'attack2'. </p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto" align="center"><img border="0" src="ingameForewardflip.jpg" width="354" height="275"> </p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Slide
      attack:</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">The
      slide attack is harder to perform than the dive attack, but successfully
      doing so ensures that your targets will drop the ball. It is also possible
      to pick up the ball mid-slide. To perform the slide attack, run forward,
      press duck and 'attack2'.</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto" align="center"><img border="0" src="ingame-slide.jpg" width="206" height="292"></p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Backflip:</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">The
      backflip has swiftly earn it's reputation in the Kanonball arsenal of
      counter-measures. By performing a backflip, it is possible for players to
      backflip right over the top of their opponents. This move can be be
      surprisingly valuable in many situations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>To backflip, simply push attack2 while running backwards.</p>

      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Side-dodge:</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Clones
      can also perform a swift dodging manuever that can be useful in several
      circumstances. Like other special moves, this can be performed while in
      possession of the ball, and it is also possible to catch the ball during
      mid-dodge flips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To dodge,
      simply push attack2 while strafing.</p>

      Charging</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto" align="left">Shoulder
      charging is powerful attack that knock players down.&nbsp; To activate
      this move you need to pick up some speed and then press 'F' or
      mouse3.&nbsp; The clone will brace it shoulder and accelerate.&nbsp; But
      be careful, once in the charge, there is no way to stop nor turn, so take
      you time to aim.</p>

      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto" align="left">Blocking</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto" align="left">While
      not moving and holding down the Shoulder Charge key, you are in a braced
      stance.&nbsp; You are protected from all sides, in which no player can run
      you down.&nbsp; When we say from all sides, we mean from all sides, but
      not up.&nbsp; Players can still knock you down from above.&nbsp; Also
      while blocking, you can not move nor perform any other action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Super-moves:</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Clones
      can also perform several 'super moves', that can be handy when used
      appropriately. Clones can perform the following super-moves:</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">-<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">
      </span>Powerjump: Crouch, look where you want to jump, then jump!</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">- Super backflip: Crouch, then backflip</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Ball-Lock:</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">There
      are times that the player will wish to know the exact location of the ball
      immediately - typically when getting up after being knocked down. By
      pressing the ball-snap key the player's view perspective will ping and
      center to the ball. This function is particularly handy for players who
      lose sight of the ball, or are using the keyboard or console controller to
      control the player's movements. </p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Feign
      Throw:</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Your
      clone also has the ability to feign a throw - he'll pretend to throw the
      ball.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To feign, simply charge
      up a throw, but instead of releasing it, push PASS (default F when you
      have the ball).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You can also
      use this to cancel a powerthrow you may have charged.</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Kanonball
      power up:</p>
      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">A
      team in total command of the ball can eventually command the ball's
      behavior. If one team manages to continue to successfully throw / pass and
      intercept the ball 3 times consecutively without letting it hit the ground
      or a wall, the player who receives the ball on the 3rd pass will have the
      ability to throw a Kanonball. By charging up the ball (in the same way as
      charging it up for a long throw) the ball can throw the ball like a
      missile, and any player who attempts to intercept it will be knocked out.
      However, take make your aim fast or else the ball will overload and shock
      you. </p>

      <p style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">The arenas
      are a little more complicated than most conventional sports. To score,
      each map is loaded with different challenges. Some maps will require to
      hit a button with the ball, while other will have moving goals.&nbsp; Teams must have
      study the maps before hand so they will not get lost in the middle of the
      game.&nbsp; If don't know how to score, then give the ball to someone else
      to watch and learn.&nbsp; Remember, your team's goal is your color and you score
      into your own goal.</p>
